1) what is node.js
Ans) node is an open-source runtime environment that allows to run js code outside of browser, typically on server 
key features:
a) Asynchronous I/O => Handles multiple tasks without waiting for one to finish uses features like promises, callbacks, async/await
b) Single threaded => Despite being single-threaded, it can handle thousands of concurrent connections using an event loop.
c) Open Source => Maintained by a large community, with numerous libraries available via npm (Node Package Manager).

Q) What is express
Ans)

Q) How to install express
Ans- 
=> npm init to initialize the directory as node.js project
=> npm install express --save

Q) with example
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3001

app.get('/', (req, res)=>{
    res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, ()=>{
    console.log(server is running on port : ${port});
})
Ans) 
=> const express = require('express')
This imports the express module into your project. express is a Node.js framework for building web servers and APIs.

=> app.get('/', (req, res) => { res.send('Hello World!') }) 
app.get() is a method in Express that used to handle GET requests and it accepts two arguments
The first argument '/' specifies the path of the route
The second argument is a callback function (called a route handler) that takes two parameters:
req (request): Contains details of the incoming request, such as query parameters or headers.
res (response): Used to send back data to the client.

=> res.send('Hello World!')
sends an HTTP response with the string "Hello World!" to the server

=> app.listen(port, () => { console.log})
This starts the server and makes it listen for incoming requests on the specified port

Q ) when the file is having another directory than index.js file ?
Ans- ENOENT - error no entity
=> res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'));
However, based on the structure in the image, the index.html file is located inside the new folder, not directly in the starter folder. Thus, the relative path is incorrect.

CORRECT WAY when a file is stored in another folder
=> res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'new', 'index.html'));
